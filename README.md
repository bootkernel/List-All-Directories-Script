# List All Directories Script
A simple bash script that lists all folders and subfolders in the directory where the script is executed. The list will appear in a text folder in the same directory.
 
I've only tested this on macOS. It will run on other Unix and Unix-like systems. 
It's part of a greater family of small functions in the Opearting System I've been working on.
